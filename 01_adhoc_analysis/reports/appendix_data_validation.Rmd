```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

Raw data was validated against the following criteria: 
1.  `incident_date` should have a value. Don't pass NAs
1.  `state` should be a two-letter abbreviation\
1.  `airport_id` should be a four-letter code\
1.  Flight phase can be cross checked with height, though this could be a bit inaccurate since we are not taking into account airport elevation:
  a.  climb < 1000 ft
  a.  en route >= 1000 ft
  a.  descent > 1000 ft  
  a.  approach <= 1000 ft
  a.  ground ops (arrival, departure, landing roll, local, parked, take-off run, taxi) should be at a low altitude
